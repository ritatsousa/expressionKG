# Gene Expression Knowledge Graph for Patient Representation and Diabetes Prediction

![alt text](https://github.com/ritatsousa/expressionKG/blob/main/methodology-extension.png)

The proposed methodology has four main steps: processing gene expression data, building the KG, learning patient representations, and evaluating patient representations.
The first step corresponds to processing gene expression data. Then, the KG that integrates not only expression data from different datasets but also domain knowledge on protein function and protein interactions is built. The third step consists of generating a vector representation for each patient described in the biomedical KG. The last step involves evaluating the patient representations through diabetes prediction and distribution/ clustering of patient representations.

Run the command:
```
python3 run_experiments.py  
```

This repository provides an implementation described in the paper: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3726/paper2.pdf
