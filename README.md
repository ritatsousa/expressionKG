![alt text](https://github.com/ritatsousa/expressionKG/blob/main/methodology-extension.png)

The proposed methodology has four main steps: processing gene expression data, building the KG, learning patient representations, and evaluating patient representations.

Run the command:
```
python3 run_experiments.py  
```

This repository provides an implementation described in the paper: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3726/paper2.pdf
